                    <p>Single-Ply roofing membranes provide a variety of materials to choose from. Their main characteristic is that they are designed to be installed in one layer. They exhibit great flexibility and their resistance to UV radiation is exceptional when compared to other products.</p>

                    <p>Single-ply roofing systems have different finishes and the direct application varies depending on the manufacturer’s specifications. They are recognized for their ease of installation, competitive cost and flexible structure.</p>

                    <p>The single-ply membranes can be classified into two categories: Thermosets and Thermoplastics. Thermoset membranes are compounded from synthetic rubber polymers and are generally ideal for large roof areas because of the manufacturing size which reduces or minimizes seams. Thermoplastic membranes are plastic based and have seams that can be hot-air welded to form cohesive laps. They are usually manufactured to include a reinforcement layer, normally fiberglass or polyester that provides additional strength and stability.</p>

                    <p>The most common types of single ply roofing systems are:</p>
                    <p><strong>TPO</strong> (Thermoplastic Oleyfin) roofing systems are among the fastest growing commercial roofing products and have gained broad industry acceptance for their performance and installation advantages. As the demand for heat-reflectivity and energy efficiency increases, this roofing type has moved to the forefront of the industry. TPO single-ply roofing membranes continue to provide exceptional resistance to ultraviolet, ozone and chemical exposure.</p>

                    <p><strong>Torch down roofing</strong> systems consist of layers of fiberglass and polyester with bitumen that are added to the regular tar and gravel layering system. These extra sheets are torched down in the overlap areas during the installation process, using large flame throwing torches that melt the asphalt at the seams to join them together.</p>

                    <p><strong>Modified Bitumen</strong> systems are asphalt composition roofs with the addition of SBS (Polystyrene Butadiene Styrene) rubber or APP (Atactic Polypropylene). SBS materials are applied with hot-mopped asphalt, a cold-apply adhesive, torches for hybrid systems or self adhesive 2 part systems. Within the majority of the United States, APP modified systems are torch-applied</p>

                    <p><strong>Singh Contracting Group</strong> provides expert application of elastomeric roof coatings and our professionals are continuously trained on the latest technological advances in materials and application techniques. Cold-applied coatings and cements are those that are designed to be used at ambient temperatures, requiring little, if any, heating to facilitate application. Typically, they are comprised of a resin, a carrier solvent, reinforcing fillers, and optional reflective pigments. Upon application, the carrier solvent evaporates from the coating, leaving a cured, water resistant film. The primary advantages of roof coatings and cements are their economical, proven performance life, and ease of use. Roof coatings and cements are generally one-component products that can be applied directly from the container. Today’s coating and cements are versatile and applicator friendly. Non-flammable products are also available.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bituminous roof coatings and cements</strong> roof coatings and cements are made from “cutback” bitumen. Distillate bitumen residue is further refined to various specific physical properties through vacuum distillation or oxidization. This refined bitumen is then blended with a petroleum solvent, such as mineral spirits, to make the cutback bitumen. This blend of bituminous resin and solvent is further combined in various type mixing or dispersing vessels with special clay fillers, surfactants, fibers or fillers to create a gelled coating. Reflective aluminum pigments may also be incorporated into the mixture to formulate a coating that provides protection against the damaging effects of the sun’s rays. The proportions of each of these components ultimately determine the consistency and properties of the coating or cement.</p>

                    <p><strong>Polymeric roof coatings and cements</strong> can be formulated with a variety of synthetic resins such as acrylic, neoprene, styrene butadiene, urethane, polyvinyl acetate and others. The enhanced performance properties achieved by using these resins include, but are not limited to: low temperature flexibility, chemical resistance and elasticity. Like bituminous coatings, polymeric coatings can be either solvent or waterborne. In addition, they can also incorporate fibers, fillers, clays and pigments to achieve the desired consistencies and properties.</p>

                    <p><strong>Polymer Modified coatings</strong> and cements are a hybrid of the previously discussed groups. They are manufactured by combining a portion of the polymeric technology with bitumen technology. The resultant coating or cement exhibits an economical blend of performance properties and characteristics. These coatings and cements are also available in solvent and water borne versions, with a selection of consistencies and properties.</p>
